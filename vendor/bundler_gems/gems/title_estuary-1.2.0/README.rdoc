Title Estuary is a gem/plugin that makes it easy to set page titles.
It it built with internationalization in mind. It requires
ActiveSupport's I18N, but should be usable with frameworks other
than Rails.

=== How-To

==== 1: tell Rails about the gem:

  # in RAILS_ROOT/config/environment.rb:
  config.gem 'title_estuary', :source => 'http://gemcutter.org'
  
==== 2: have Rails install the gem:

  [sudo] rake gems:install
  
==== 3: set up your layout:

  # in RAILS_ROOT/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:
  <html ...>
    <head ...>
      <title><%= page_title %></title>
      ...
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1><%= page_title %></h1>
      ...
    </body>
  </html>

==== 4. customize your titles:

Use the format "page.title.controller_name.action_name"

  # in RAILS_ROOT/config/locales/en.yml:
  en:
    page:
      title:
        accounts:
          new:    "Sign Up"
        sessions:
          new:    "Sign In"
        projects:
          index:  "Your projects"
          new:    "Start a new project"
    
If you want to use any interpolated strings, make sure
you define an <tt>#interpolation_options</tt> method in
your controller:

  # in RAILS_ROOT/config/locales/en.yml:
  en:
    page:
      title:
        projects:
          index:  "All {{number_of_projects}} of your projects"
          show:   "Project {{project_name}}"
          edit:   "Edit project {{project_name}}"
  
  # An example controller (that would be defined
  # in RAILS_ROOT/app/controllers/projects_controller.rb).
  class ProjectsController < ActionController::Base
    # An example definition of <tt>#interpolation_options</tt>
    # that sets certain project-related values as applicable.
    #
    # @return [Hash] a hash of interpolation values
    def interpolation_options
      returning({}) do |result|
        result[:number_of_projects] = @projects.size if @projects.present?
        result[:project_name] = @project.name if @project.present?
        result[:project_id] = params[:id]
      end
    end
    hide_action :interpolation_options
  end
  
If you need more dynamic titles than simple interpolation affords,
set the title manually in an action:

  # in RAILS_ROOT/app/controllers/projects_controller.rb:
  class ProjectsController < ActionController::Base
    def show
      @project = Project.find(params[:id])
      self.page_title = "A title based on #{@project.some_complex_string}"
    end
  end
  
or in a filter:

  # in RAILS_ROOT/app/controllers/projects_controller.rb:
  class ProjectsController < ActionController::Base
    before_filter :set_title
    private
    def set_title
      self.page_title = "Some complex title"
    end
  end
  
or from a view:

  # in RAILS_ROOT/app/view/projects/index.html.erb:
  <% content_for :page_title do %>
    Some complex page title
  <% end %>

=== Integration with Inherited Resources

When included in a controller class that inherits
from <tt>InheritedResources::Base</tt>, Title Estuary
uses <tt>:resource_class</tt> when building default
page names.

@see TitleEstuary::InheritedResourcesSupport
@see http://github.com/josevalim/inherites_resources 

=== Integration with High Voltage

When included in a controller class that inherits
from <tt>HighVoltage::PagesController</tt>,
Title Estuary uses the page title as the default title.
It also changes the i18n key scheme to
"page.title.<controller>.<page_name>" to let you
define different titles for each page.  For example:

  en:
    page:
      title:
        pages:
          faq: "Frequently Asked Questions"

*Nota Bene*: if you include +TitleEstuary+ in
your +ApplicationController+, you'll need to
re-include it in the +PagesController+. If you're using
High Voltage's default controller, you can do so in an
initializer:

  # in RAILS_ROOT/config/initializers/page_titles_for_high_voltage:
  HighVoltage::PagesController.class_eval do
    include TitleEstuary
  end
  
If, on the other hand, you're defining your own
+PagesController+, you can include it there:

  # in RAILS_ROOT/app/controllers/pages_controller.rb:
  # An example custom PagesController.
  class PagesController < HighVoltage::PagesController
    include TitleEstuary
  end
